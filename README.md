# WTFDAG - Where The F\*ck Does Aero Go?

WTFDIG is a helper tool for Final Fantasy XIV players that enables them to view condensed strategy guides for various high-end duties. Users can select a fight, specific strategies, their role, and their light party to get customized, easy-to-read guides with visual aids. WTFDIG was written by mara and is hosted at <https://wtfdig.info/>.
